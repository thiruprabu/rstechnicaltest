Comments:

> The 2 end to end BDD test scenarios designed are quite longer and detailed. Though it is not ideal, I designed in that way to cover the major end to end flow of RSComponents website within 2 tests. I would normally prefer my scenarios to be precise and specific to each functionality.

> There are possibilities to add lots of validations in the test scenarios. I have added quite a few of them in the given time.
