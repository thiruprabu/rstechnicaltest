Comments:

> The 3 BDD test scenarios designed are quite longer and detailed. Though it is not ideal, I designed in that way to cover the major functionalities of CTM within 3 tests. I would normally prefer my scenarios to be precise and specific to each functionality.

> There are possibilities to add lots of validations in the test scenarios. I have added quite a few of them in the given time.
